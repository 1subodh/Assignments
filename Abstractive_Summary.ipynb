      "1. A young boy, barely aged 8 years, cheerful and full of life,\n",
      "was trying to cross the road accompanied by his household help.\n",
      "His life was full of joy, happiness, his future full of possibilities.\n",
      "Before he crossed the road all that changed. Knocked down by a\n",
      "speeding vehicle, he lost his consciousness, remained in coma for\n",
      "Page 1 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "six months. For the remainder of his life, he wished he had not\n",
      "regained consciousness. He has filed this petition seeking our\n",
      "opinion whether income tax department was justified in taking\n",
      "away 30% of the interest on the compensation which was\n",
      "determined nearly 36 years after the accident. Looking to the\n",
      "issues involved, we have heard the learned Counsel for the parties\n",
      "for final disposal of the petition. The petition arises in the following\n",
      "background:\n",
      "FACTS:\n",
      "The petitioner is presently aged about 48 years. When he\n",
      "was about 8 years old, on 18.10.1978, he was trying to cross\n",
      "Nepensea Road in South Mumbai accompanied by a household\n",
      "servant when a car insured by Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. -\n",
      "Respondent No.4, collided with the young boy causing serious\n",
      "injuries. His brain was severely damaged. He remained in the\n",
      "hospital in an unconscious state for several months. His parents\n",
      "brought him home setting up a nursing station at home and\n",
      "administered all necessary treatment. Though several months\n",
      "later, he regained consciousness, his brain injuries left him\n",
      "paraplegic. Further, treatments, therapies and cures failed to have\n",
      "Page 2 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "the desired effect. His mental growth also stunted. Ever since the\n",
      "date of the accident, he is left completely bed ridden, needs\n",
      "constant attention even for routine activities.\n",
      "2. On his behalf, his father had filed Motor Accident Claim\n",
      "Petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Greater\n",
      "Mumbai. He had initially sought a compensation of Rs.1 lakh from\n",
      "the driver, owner and insurer of the vehicle involved in the\n",
      "accident, which was subsequently revised to Rs.15 lakhs. Yet\n",
      "another application was filed before the Motor Accident Claims\n",
      "Tribunal raising the claim to Rs.50 lakhs. The Tribunal, however,\n",
      "did not find any evidence of such application having been allowed.\n",
      "3. More than 10 years after the accident, the Tribunal disposed\n",
      "of the Claim Petition by award dated 30.3.1990. The Tribunal held\n",
      "that the driver of the car was solely negligent in causing the\n",
      "accident. The Tribunal awarded compensation under various\n",
      "heads such as future loss of income; pain; shock and suffering;\n",
      "loss of amenities of life; cost of medical treatment, etc. and\n",
      "awarded a total compensation of Rs.4,12,000/- to be paid jointly\n",
      "and severally by the owner and the insurance company with\n",
      "interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of the Claim Petition till\n",
      "Page 3 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "realisation. The Tribunal also directed that if this amount is not\n",
      "paid within three months, the rate of interest payable would be\n",
      "12% p.a. on the unpaid amount.\n",
      "4. By the time the Tribunal disposed of the Claim Petition, the\n",
      "petitioner had become major. He was brought on record in his\n",
      "personal capacity. He filed First Appeal before the Bombay High\n",
      "Court against the said judgment and award of the Claim Tribunal\n",
      "and sought enhancement of the compensation. Several years\n",
      "later his appeal was disposed of by a judgment dated 21.11.2014.\n",
      "The learned Single Judge awarded total compensation of\n",
      "Rs.39,92,000/- to be paid with interest at the rate of 9% per\n",
      "annum.\n",
      "5. The insurance company challenged the said judgment of the\n",
      "High Court before the Supreme Court by filing Special Leave\n",
      "Petition. The said SLP came to be dismissed on 5.5.2015.\n",
      "6. In an Execution Petition filed by the petitioner, the insurance\n",
      "company deposited an amount of Rs.1,42,04,415/- pursuant to the\n",
      "judgment of the High Court after deducting tax at source.\n",
      "According to the petitioner, no TDS should have been deducted.\n",

      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "Under protest, however, he withdrew the compensation amount of\n",
      "Rs.1,42,04,415/-. The break-up of the amount payable to the\n",
      "petitioner would show that on the principal sum of Rs.39,92,000/-\n",
      "as awarded by this Court, interest @ 9% for 36 years came to\n",
      "Rs.1,18,04,606/-. The insurance company before depositing the\n",
      "amount, deducted tax at source a sum of Rs.11,80,461/- @ 10%\n",
      "on the interest component.\n",
      "7. The petitioner had received interest of Rs.1,18,04,606/-\n",
      "during the period relevant to the A.Y. 2016-2017. According to the\n",
      "petitioner, such interest was not taxable. However, by way of\n",
      "caution, the petitioner filed the return of income for the A.Y. 2016 –\n",
      "2017 in which he had presented the computation of his taxable\n",
      "income if the interest received by him was made taxable. His tax\n",
      "liability came to Rs.37,97,773/-, which also he had deposited with\n",
      "the Income Tax department. In the return of income, he had put\n",
      "the following note in order to dispute the taxability of the interest:\n",
      "“NOTE: As per the stand taken by the Assessee the\n",
      "interest amount on such insurance income received\n",
      "should be treated as capital receipt and hence Income\n",
      "Tax should not be applicable on it. The Assessee has\n",
      "paid the Income Tax amount under protest.”\n",
      "Page 5 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "8. This petition was initially filed with a prayer for a declaration\n",
      "that no tax at source is required to be deducted on the interest\n",
      "component of the compensation in motor accident claims. The\n",
      "petitioner had also prayed for a direction to refund the sum of\n",
      "Rs.37,97,773/- which he had paid to the Income Tax department\n",
      "while filing the return of income. The petitioner had also\n",
      "challenged the vires of section 194A (3)(ix) and (ixa) as also\n",
      "section 145A(b) and 56(2)(viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’\n",
      "for short).\n",
      "9. When this petition was pending, the Assessing Officer\n",
      "passed an order of assessment under section 143(3) of the Act on\n",
      "30.11.2018 and assessed the petitioner’s total income at\n",
      "Rs.1,14,99,380/- which comprised of the interest received on the\n",
      "compensation minus available deductions. He rejected the\n",
      "petitioner’s contention that such interest was not taxable. He was\n",
      "of the opinion that the interest on compensation was distinct and\n",
      "independent of the principal and the interest therefore, would be\n",
      "income from other sources. Most unkindly, he also ordered\n",
      "issuance of notice of penalty under section 271(1)(c) of the Act\n",
      "completely ignoring the fact that the petitioner himself had filed the\n",

      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "return of income, disclosed the interest income and subject to his\n",
      "objection to its taxability, also paid the full tax thereon. The\n",
      "petitioner was allowed to amend the petition and challenge this\n",
      "order of assessment.\n",
      "10. As noted, at the time of filing of the petition, the dispute was\n",
      "with respect to deduction of tax at source on the interest\n",
      "component of the enhanced compensation. Before this issue\n",
      "could be resolved, the final assessment was made by the\n",
      "Assessing Officer holding the entire interest receipt taxable as\n",
      "income from other sources. The issue of validity of deducting tax\n",
      "at source has thus, merged into the larger question of very\n",

      "RIVAL STANDS -\n",
      "CASE OF THE PETITIONER -\n",
      "15. The stand of the petitioner is that the interest component on\n",
      "the motor accident claim compensation paid to the petitioner is not\n",
      "taxable. The first contention of the petitioner is that the interest is\n",
      "a capital receipt. The other contention is that the interest is\n",
      "compensatory in nature. It is meant to offset the erosion of the\n",
      "principal compensation because of passage of time and the\n",
      "reduction of purchasing power of rupee due to inflation. According\n",
      "to the petitioner since the compensation itself is not taxable, the\n",
      "interest pendente lite which also forms part of the compensation,\n",
      "would not be taxable. When the receipt itself is not taxable, the\n",
      "question of deducting tax at source while making payment thereof\n",
      "would not arise. It was lastly contended that in any case, such\n",
      "Page 10 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "interest should be spread over the entire period for which it is paid.\n",
      "The interest accrues from year to year. Merely because it is paid\n",
      "at a single point, would not mean the entire amount is taxable in\n",
      "the year of payment.\n",
      "THE STAND OF THE DEPARTMENT:\n",
      "16. The Department contends that the interest is an income\n",
      "distinct from the compensation and is, therefore, taxable. By virtue\n",
      "of clause (b) of section 145A of the Act, such income is taxable on\n",
      "actual receipt. Heavy reliance is placed on the provisions\n",
      "contained in section 56(2)(viii), section 145A(b) and section 194A\n",
      "of the Act. It was pointed out that section 145A was amended by\n",
      "the Finance Act of 2009 in order to obviate the difficulties arising\n",
      "out the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Rama Bai\n",
      "and ors. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Andhra Pradesh,\n",
      "Hyderabad and Ors.1\n",
      ". The learned ASG had argued that looking\n",
      "to these statutory provisions, any interest on compensation or\n",
      "enhanced compensation of motor accident claims would be\n",
      "chargeable to tax as income from other sources and the point of\n",
      "chargeability would be the actual receipt. A conjoint reading of\n",
      "1 181 ITR 400\n",
      "Page 11 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "clause (viii) of sub-section (2) of section 56, clause (b) of section\n",
      "145A and section 194A (3) of the Act would lead to an inescapable\n",
      "conclusion that interest on the compensation or enhanced\n",
      "compensation would be chargeable as income from other sources\n",
      "at the point of time when the same is actually received by the\n",
      "claimants.\n",
      "ARGUMENTS OF AMICUS CURIAE:-\n",
      "17. Considering the fact that the petition involved complex\n",
      "issues, answers to which would have wider ramifications, the Court\n",
      "had requested the learned Senior Counsel Mr.Jehangir Mistri to\n",
      "assist the Court as Amicus Curiae. He had graciously accepted\n",
      "the request and ably assisted the Court with painstaking\n",
      "preparations and usual flare. He had presented various\n",
      "propositions on the interpretation of the relevant sections. He had\n",
      "also presented the decisions of various Courts adopting different\n",
      "view points. His analysis is as follows.\n",
      "i) Whether the interest received on compensation or\n",
      "enhanced compensation is income would be the\n",
      "fundamental issue. One way of interpreting section 194A(3)\n",
      "(ix), section 145A(b) and section 56(2)(viii) would be that\n",
      "Page 12 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "none of these provisions make such interest chargeable to\n",
      "tax if it is otherwise not taxable. The taxability of the interest\n",
      "would depend on the nature and the purpose for grant of\n",
      "interest. If it is held that the interest is compensatory in\n",
      "nature and forms part of the compensation, the same may\n",
      "not be exigible to tax since both sides have proceeded on\n",
      "the basis that the compensation per se is not taxable.\n",
      "ii) The question would also arise whether post-insertion of\n",
      "section 145A(b), the spread-over theory of interest on\n",
      "compensation, which was first time adopted by the Gujarat\n",
      "High Court in the case of Gauri Deepak Patel & ors. vs.\n",
      "New India Assurance Co. Ltd.2\n",
      ", would stand overruled.\n",
      "iii) If the spread over theory is to be applied, deduction of\n",
      "tax at source will be needed only if the payment of interest in\n",
      "a year exceeds Rs.50,000/-.\n",

      "55. In order to ascertain the taxability of interest on\n",
      "compensation or enhanced compensation in motor accident claim\n",
      "cases, we, therefore would have to ascertain the true nature of\n",
      "interest. Even the Assessing Officer has proceeded on the basis\n",
      "that the compensation by itself is not taxable. As noted earlier,\n",
      "income of the deceased or the injured for earmarking\n",

      "the context of the nature of the interest awarded by the Claims\n",
      "Tribunal or the High Court on motor accident claim compensation\n",
      "or enhanced compensation, we have referred to the decisions of\n",
      "the Supreme Court including in cases of Abati Bezbaruah (supra),\n",
      "Kaushnuma Begum (supra), Patricia G. Mahajan (supra) and\n",
      "Dharampal (supra). These decisions suggest that the interest is\n",

      "award interest flows from section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act,\n",
      "1988. As is well settled, the authority of the Court to award interest\n",
      "must be traced to a statutory provision or in agreement between\n",
      "the parties. In absence of section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act,\n",
      "Page 47 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "perhaps it would not be lawful for the Tribunal and for that matter,\n",
      "the High Court in Appeal, to award interest on compensation. The\n",
      "Supreme Court in the cases of Abati Bezbaruah (supra),\n",
      "Kaushnuma Begum (supra), Patricia G. Mahajan (supra) and\n",
      "Dharampal (supra), explained the nature of interest awarded in\n",
      "motor accident claims cases. Culmination of discussion in these\n",
      "judgments would be that such interest is compensatory in nature\n",
      "and will thus, form part of the compensation itself. Compensation\n",
      "is computed with reference to the date of accident. All calculations\n",
      "of multiplicand and multiplier are based on such reference point.\n",
      "But computation by the Tribunal takes time. If compensation is\n",
      "revised by the High Court it takes further time. Interest is awarded\n",

      "compensation. Awarding interest for delayed computation of\n",
      "compensation is therefore integral part of this exercise.\n",
      "56. The issue can be looked from a slightly different angle. In\n",
      "the context of interest, there are three crucial dates. The date of\n",
      "the accident is a date in reference to which the entire\n",
      "compensation is calculated. The date of filing of the claim petition\n",
      "is the date from which the claimant can seek interest on the\n",
      "Page 48 of 54\n",
      "wp.2902.2016(J).doc\n",
      "compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal. Under section\n",
      "170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the interest cannot be awarded for a\n",
      "period prior to filing of the Claim Petition. The date of passing of\n",
      "the award by Claims Tribunal is the date on which the\n",
      "compensation is determined and the right to receive interest\n",
      "pendente lite ceases. The interest for the period between the filing\n",
      "of the claim petition and passing of the award thus, is for the\n",
      "period when the claimant for the first time approached the Claims\n",
      "Tribunal asking the Tribunal to assess and award compensation\n",
      "and the time consumed in disposing of the Claim Petition. We may\n",
      "also recall, the interest can be awarded even though part of the\n",
      "compensation would comprise of future loss of income. This is so\n",
      "because, the multiplier method factors this aspect also. At the\n",
      "same time, as noted, the Courts do not award interest on future\n",
      "expenditure since the amount is being paid to the claimant for an\n",
      "expenditure which may be incurred at a later point of time. This\n",
      "dichotomy, thus, between awarding interest on future income while\n",

      "However, the fundamental question is does section 194A make the\n",
